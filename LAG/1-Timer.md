Great idea. Creating vehicles gradually using a timer instead of all at once is a solid way to reduce lag.

## âœ… Hereâ€™s How to Implement Delayed Vehicle Creation

Letâ€™s assume:

* You have a list/array of all the vehicle data (coords, model, etc.).
* You want to create one vehicle every 1 second, rather than all at once.
* We'll use a global index and a `SetTimer` to step through the creation.

---

### ðŸ§  Step-by-step logic:

1. Store vehicle info in an array.
2. Create a global index (`g_VehicleCreateIndex`).
3. Use `SetTimer` to call a function every 1 second.
4. Inside that function, create **1 vehicle** each call until done.

---

### ðŸ§¾ Sample Code

Put this **at the top** of your filterscript:

```pawn
#define MAX_STREAMED_VEHICLES 1000

new VehicleData[MAX_STREAMED_VEHICLES][5]; // modelid, x, y, z, angle
new g_VehicleCreateIndex = 0;
new g_VehicleCreateTimer;
new g_VehiclesCreated = 0;

new StreamedVehicles[MAX_STREAMED_VEHICLES]; // store created vehicle IDs
```

---

### ðŸš— Fill your `VehicleData` array somewhere:

```pawn
stock LoadVehicleData() {
    // Example â€” you can load this from a file, MySQL, etc.
    VehicleData[0][0] = 411; // model
    VehicleData[0][1] = 1234.0; // x
    VehicleData[0][2] = 567.0;  // y
    VehicleData[0][3] = 20.0;   // z
    VehicleData[0][4] = 90.0;   // angle

    VehicleData[1][0] = 522;
    VehicleData[1][1] = 1240.0;
    VehicleData[1][2] = 570.0;
    VehicleData[1][3] = 20.0;
    VehicleData[1][4] = 180.0;

    g_VehiclesCreated = 2; // total vehicles filled
}
```

---

### ðŸ•’ Delayed creation timer function:

```pawn
forward CreateNextVehicle();

public CreateNextVehicle()
{
    if (g_VehicleCreateIndex >= g_VehiclesCreated) {
        KillTimer(g_VehicleCreateTimer);
        printf("All vehicles created with delay.");
        return 0;
    }

    new model = VehicleData[g_VehicleCreateIndex][0];
    new Float:x = VehicleData[g_VehicleCreateIndex][1];
    new Float:y = VehicleData[g_VehicleCreateIndex][2];
    new Float:z = VehicleData[g_VehicleCreateIndex][3];
    new Float:a = VehicleData[g_VehicleCreateIndex][4];

    StreamedVehicles[g_VehicleCreateIndex] = CreateVehicle(model, x, y, z, a, -1, -1, -1);
    printf("Created vehicle %d at index %d", model, g_VehicleCreateIndex);

    g_VehicleCreateIndex++;
    return 1;
}
```

---

### ðŸš€ Start everything:

Inside `OnGameModeInit()` or `OnFilterScriptInit()`:

```pawn
LoadVehicleData(); // load your vehicle data
g_VehicleCreateIndex = 0;
g_VehicleCreateTimer = SetTimer("CreateNextVehicle", 1000, true); // every 1 second
```

---

## âœ… Result

This system creates **one vehicle per second**. You can also:

* Decrease the interval to 500ms if needed.
* Use a per-player streaming version later for optimization (vehicles near each player only).

Let me know if you want to expand this to stream/unstream vehicles near players dynamically too.
